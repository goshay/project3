    <p>Hi my name is Shamine Tate, future full-stack developer. I'm currently on a journey to achieve that goal with the <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/" target="_blank">Correlation One</a> training program. I've had an interest in coding since being a pre-teen, but never knew it was something that could be a career, so it was a dream deferred. When I learned about all the opportunies in coding a few years ago it sparked that fire again and I decided to go for it again. I did self-taught for a bit with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">FreeCode Camp</a>, but self-taught lacked the structure I needed. I'm now re-learning HTML and soon CCS in the course. I'm <u>VERY</u> nervous about Javascript, but I know I won't let it stop me from reaching my goal.</p>
    <p>I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shamine-tate-58347297" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> account, but if you go there now you won't see much. That will soon change though because this program will also provide me with guidance on how to revamp, improve, and update my account to include the skills that I have/will learn. I know the possibilities will be endless and that is something I'm willing to hang my hat on!&#128522; </p>
